     <h1><p class="text-center">About P-Store</h1>
     <p class="text-center">In the Philippines, online grocery stores have been around for a while. Some of these online shops even started operating before the COVID-19 outbreak. More online supermarkets have opened during the pandemic. Suddenly, Filipinos have realized their value now that the country is under quarantine.
     So that you do not risk spreading or getting infected with the coronavirus, just stay at home and order your needed food and supplies from online grocery shops with delivery service.
     if you are a person who runs your grocery shop, you could be of great help to thousands of home-makers, by using the application. People, especially homemakers face the problem of going far to the market and getting grocery which is time-consuming. Ladies who are office-goers find it the most difficult. Ladies hardly get any time to buy grocery apart from doing all kinds of household chores. It would be more comfortable and time-saving for them if they could
     buy grocery online and get all their grocery at their doors with just a click or grab it packed along the way. 

     The team of researchers came up with the idea of creating P-Store because of the problems being encountered, specially at this time. P-Store is an online web and mobile store where customers can shop groceries online. P-store is not just cater in-cash payment but also credit. Customer can credit groceries, specially to those customers who do not have the budget or either have problems in their financial status. 
     Through this system, there will be a bigger chance of survival in the community.
